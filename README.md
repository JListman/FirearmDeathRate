# FirearmDeathRate
This project combines data on firearm laws from Boston University's [State Firearm Laws Project](https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/index.html) with CDC WONDER data on firearm death rates per State per Year and uses
a regression tree to predict firearm death rate. Read my [blog post](https://medium.com/@jblistman) summarizing the results.
